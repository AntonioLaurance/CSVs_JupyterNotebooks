The petitions in these cases seek review of the judgments of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Al-Najar v. Obama, No. 12-5401 (CADC 2013), and Amanatullah v. Obama, No. 12-5407 (CADC 2013). They do not seek review of the judgments in Al Maqaleh v. Hagel, No. 12-5404 (CADC 2013), or Al Bakri v. Obama, No. 12-5399 (CADC 2013), which were consolidated with petitioners' appeals. Subsequent to the decisions of the court below, petitioners were transferred from the custody of the United States to the custody of other nations. As a result, these cases have become moot. We therefore grant the petitions and vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals with respect to these petitioners. See United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U. S. 36 (1950); Al-Marri v. Spagone, 555 U. S. 1220 (2009). The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis in No. 14-6575 is granted. Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion and these petitions. ORDERS IN PENDING CASES 14M93 ANTHONY, CLYDE V. COFFEE COUNTY, GA, ET AL. 14M94 BOWMAN, EDUARDO V.
