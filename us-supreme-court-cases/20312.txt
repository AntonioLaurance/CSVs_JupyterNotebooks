C. §2109, which provides that under these circumstances "the court shall enter its order affirming the judgment of the court from which the case was brought for review with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court." The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition. 15-6219 BAEZ-MARTINEZ, JORGE V.
