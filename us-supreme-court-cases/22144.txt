10-935 SMITH, KENNETH L. V. THOMAS, JUSTICE, USSC, ET AL.

cannot be heard and determined at the next Term of Court, the
judgment is affirmed under 28 U.S.C. §2109, which provides
that under these circumstances "the court shall enter its order
affirming the judgment of the court from which the case was
brought for review with the same effect as upon affirmance by an
equally divided court." The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice
Breyer, Justice Alito, and Justice Sotomayor took no part in the
consideration or decision of this petition.
