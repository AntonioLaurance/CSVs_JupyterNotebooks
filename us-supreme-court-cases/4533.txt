Said boundary commences at Latitude 31ø59'56.225" North and Longitude 94ø02'33.105" West, thence proceeding in a southerly direction along the Sabine River using the federal line as shown for the boundary on the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Center, Tex.-La., 1958 Edition (photorevised 1969) and signed by Hatley N.

And thence, as shown on Exhibit 13, which is in evidence herein, the boundary from the point last mentioned through Middle Pass at the mouth of the Sabine River and through Sabine Lake and Pass to the seaward end of the jetties is defined by straight lines between points in either Louisiana (Lambert) Coordinate System, South Zone, or Texas (Lambert) Coordinate System, South Central Zone, whose geographic positions are as follows:

2. That the offshore lateral boundary between the States of Texas and Louisiana seaward from the point Latitude 29ø38'37.329" North, Longitude 93ø49'30.940" West (end of jetties) is a line running South-Southeasterly from said point on a constant bearing of South 13ø44'45.8" east true to the seaward limit of Louisiana's Submerged Lands Act grant. Texas' historic boundary then continues offshore on the same bearing to the point Latitude 29ø32'06.784" North, Longitude 93ø47'41.699" West. This offshore lateral boundary and the Texas historical boundary are shown upon Exhibit 14 which is in evidence in this case.

Louisiana does not hold title to or interest in any island in the west half of the Sabine River. The United States and Texas do not hold title to or interest in any island in the east half of the Sabine River.
4. That Exhibits 1-14, in evidence herein and above mentioned, be certified by the Special Master as delineating the [431 U.S. 161, 168]   boundary between the State of Texas and the State of Louisiana, from Latitude 32ø North, as defined herein, to the seaward limits of Louisiana's Submerged Land Act grant, and the seaward limits of Texas' historical boundary, as defined herein, and that the State of Louisiana be directed to deposit a copy of these maps, so certified by the Special Master, along with a certified copy of this decree, with the Register of the State Land Office for the State of Louisiana, and that the State of Texas be directed to deposit a set of these maps, so certified by the Special Master, along with a certified copy of this decree, with the Commissioner of the General Land Office of the State of Texas.
5. That the costs be taxed to the parties in accordance with their contribution to the fund established by the Special Master, and that no costs be taxed for the services of the Special Master.
6. That any unexpended funds contributed by the parties to the Special Master for necessary expenses be returned to the parties.
7. That upon such return of funds the Honorable Robert Van Pelt, the Special Master appointed in this cause, will have completed his duties, and is thereupon discharged. [431 U.S. 161, 169]
