It further appearing that substantial revenues derived from lands lying wholly within said area are now being held impounded by the United States pursuant to the parties' Interim Agreement of October 12, 1956, as amended, on file herein, and that there is no reason why the Court should not at this time enter a supplemental [404 U.S. 388, 389]   decree declaring the rights of the United States in the described area and terminating the obligation of the United States to hold impounded the revenues heretofore or hereafter derived from leases of lands lying wholly within the described area:

2. All sums now held impounded by the United States under the Interim Agreement of October 12, 1956, as amended, derived from leases of lands lying wholly within the area referred to in paragraph 1 hereof are hereby released to the United States absolutely, and the United States is hereby relieved of any obligation under said agreement to impound any sums hereafter received by it from leases of lands lying wholly within said area.
