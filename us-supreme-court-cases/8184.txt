United States Supreme Court FTC v. JANTZEN, INC., (1967) No. 310 Argued: February 14, 1967    Decided: March 13, 1967
Respondent, a manufacturer, in 1958 consented to the entry of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) cease-and-desist order prohibiting it from engaging in further discriminatory activities violating 2 (d) of the Clayton Act, and the FTC adopted the order in 1959. In 1964, following charges of additional discriminatory activities, respondent stipulated that it had committed violations of the 1959 order. The FTC petitioned the Court of Appeals to enforce the original order under the third paragraph of 11 of the original Clayton Act, which authorized the FTC to apply to a court of appeals for enforcement of its orders. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction, upholding respondent's contention that a 1959 amendment (the Finality Act) substituting new enforcement remedies for those in 11 had repealed the authority of the FTC to seek, and of the courts to grant, enforcement of FTC cease-and-desist orders entered before the Finality Act took effect. Held: FTC orders under the Clayton Act entered before the Finality Act was enacted remain enforceable under 11 of the Clayton Act. Pp. 233-236.
(a) The provision in 2 of the Finality Act making the Act's provisions inapplicable to a Clayton Act " proceeding initiated" before enactment of the Finality Act refers to the filing of the " proceeding" before the FTC and is not limited to the application for enforcement or petition for review in a court of appeals. P. 233.
(b) The express purpose of the Finality Act " to provide for the more expeditious enforcement of cease and desist orders" and the Act's legislative history are inconsistent with giving absolution to the almost 400 proven violators of the Clayton Act who are subject to pre-Finality Act orders of the FTC. P. 234.
Ralph S. Spritzer argued the cause for petitioner. On the brief were Solicitor General Marshall, Assistant [386 U.S. 228, 229]   Attorney General Turner, Nathan Lewin, Howard E. Shapiro, James McI. Henderson and Thomas F. Howder.
Edwin S. Rockefeller argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Donald H. Green and Joel E. Hoffman.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case involves the effect of the Act of July 23, 1959, 73 Stat. 243 (Finality Act), upon orders issued by the Federal Trade Commission under 11 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 734, prior to the date of the former Act. The respondent claims that the Finality Act repealed the enforcement provisions of 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 21 (1958 ed.), and that orders of the Commission entered prior to the enactment of the Finality Act are not now enforceable. The Court of Appeals agreed, held that it had no jurisdiction to enforce such orders and directed that the proceeding be dismissed. 356 F.2d 253. In view of the pendency of almost 400 such orders and the conflict among the circuits 1 on the point, we granted certiorari. 385 U.S. 810 .

The Finality Act eliminated these " laborious, time consuming, and very expensive" procedures. S. Rep. No. 83, supra, at 2. As Congressman Huddleston, one of the principal supporters of the bill which later became the Act, stated to the House:
" The bill . . . is in effect a perfecting amendment to the Clayton Act. It has no other purpose than to effect the will of Congress with respect to the role of the Federal Trade Commission in Clayton Act enforcement in the same manner and to the same degree that the will of Congress was effectuated by the Wheeler-Lea amendments to the Federal Trade Commission Act." 105 Cong. Rec. 12732.
The Wheeler-Lea Amendment clarified the procedures of the Federal Trade Commission Act but did not amend those of the Clayton Act. Under the Wheeler-Lea Amendment orders issued by the Commission were to become final 60 days after their issuance or upon affirmance by a court of appeals in which a petition for review had been filed. However, 5 (a) of the Amendment expressly provided that orders outstanding at the time [386 U.S. 228, 232]   of the adoption of the Amendment would become final 60 days after the latter date or upon affirmance in review proceedings instituted during that 60-day period. 52 Stat. 117. The Finality Act instead of using the language of 5 (a) of the Wheeler-Lea Amendment contains a special provision, 2, which reads as follows:
" The amendments made by section 1 shall have no application to any proceeding initiated before the date of enactment of this Act under the third or fourth paragraph of section 11 of the [Clayton] Act . . . . Each such proceeding shall be governed by the provisions of such section as they existed on the day preceding the date of enactment of this Act."

" The Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed. The major premise of the conclusion expressed in a statute, the change of policy that induces the enactment, may not be set out in terms, but it is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before." Johnson v. United States, 163 F. 30, 32 (1908).
[386 U.S. 228, 236]
In view of all of these considerations we cannot say that the author of the Finality Act and its sponsors - all stalwart champions of effective antitrust enforcement - would have intended to strip the Commission of all of its enforcement weapons with reference to some 400 concerns already adjudged to be Clayton Act violators. Nor could we ascribe to a Congress that has so clearly expressed its will any such result. We can only say that as between choices Congress rejected only one, namely, that of the Wheeler-Lea Act's 60-day review provision. Certainly it intended that the old procedures would apply to proceedings on petition for review or application for enforcement. There is no evidence that it intended to put the pre-1959 orders into the discard. We remain more faithful to the Act, we think, when we find that they too are enforceable under the old procedures.
Reversed and remanded.

[ Footnote 2 ] The penalties were raised to $5,000 for each day in which a violation continued.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.
While I confess to great difficulty in driving through the statute to the Court's conclusion, I am content to acquiesce in my Brother CLARK's opinion with the added help of the Second Circuit's opinion in F. T. C. v. Standard Motor Products, Inc., 371 F.2d 613. [386 U.S. 228, 237]
