FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2015 ORDER IN PENDING CASE 14-1516     DUNCAN, WARDEN V. OWENS, LAWRENCE (15A475)
The application to recall and stay the mandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in case No. 14-1419, presented to Justice Kagan and by her referred to the Court, is granted pending the sending down of the judgment of this Court. The request seeking that the respondent be returned to applicant's custody pending final disposition of this case is denied, thus leaving that determination for the state court.
