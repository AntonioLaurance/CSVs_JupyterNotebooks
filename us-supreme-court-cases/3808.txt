The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis is denied, and the petition for a writ of habeas corpus
is dismissed. See Rule 39.8. As the petitioner has repeatedly
abused this Court's process, the Clerk is directed not to accept
any further petitions in noncriminal matters from petitioner
unless the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) is paid and the
petition is submitted in compliance with Rule 33.1. See Martin
v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1 (1992) (per
curiam). Justice Stevens dissents. See id., at 4, and cases
