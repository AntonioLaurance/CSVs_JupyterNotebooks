United States Supreme Court DUTTON v. PLAIRET, (1869) No. 184 Argued:     Decided: November 8, 1869
Mr. Chief Justice CHASE delivered the opinion of the court. [154 U.S. 563, 564]   The same questions substantially are presented in this case as in the case of Bronson v. Rhodes (heretofore decided at this term) 7 Wall. 229. The principles settled by that judgment require that the judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
David W. Sellers, for plaintiff in error.
