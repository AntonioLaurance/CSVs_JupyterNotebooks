CERTIORARI -- SUMMARY DISPOSITIONS
08-9723 MOORE, TERRANCE V. OHIO
The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.
The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Court
of Appeals of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, for further consideration
in light of Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. ___ (2009).
09-906 SIBLEY, MONTGOMERY B. V. ALITO, JUSTICE, USSC, ET AL.
Because the Court lacks a quorum, 28 U.S.C. §1, and since
the only qualified Justice is of the opinion that the case
cannot be heard and determined at the next Term of Court, the
judgment is affirmed under 28 U.S.C. §2109, which provides
that under these circumstances "the court shall enter its order
affirming the judgment of the court from which the case was
brought for review with the same effect as upon affirmance by
an equally divided court." The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Alito took no part in
the consideration or decision of this petition.
09-6208 D. G. V. LOUISIANA
