United States Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. BOSTON & M. R. CO., (1965) No. 232 Argued: January 21, 1965    Decided: March 8, 1965
Appellees, a railroad and three of its officers, were indicted under 10 of the Clayton Act for participating in the noncompetitive sale of equipment to another corporation in which the officers had a "substantial interest," described in a bill of particulars as an agreement for substantial payment to the individual appellees for effecting the sale. Holding that 10 applies to a "then present legal interest," and not one dependent on the outcome of an illegal plan, the District Court dismissed the indictment Held:
1. Under the strict construction applicable to a criminal statute, the words "substantial interest" in 10 presuppose, not bribery (which the indictment here in effect charges) under a conflict of interest law, but either an existing investment in the purchaser, the creation of the purchaser for the use of those acting for the seller, or a joint venture or continued course of dealings for profit sharing with the purchaser, each of which would be within the concept of this antitrust statute. Pp. 160-162.
2. Since an amended bill of particulars may be filed under Rule 7 (f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the case is vacated and remanded. P. 162.
Robert B. Hummel argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Orrick and John H. Dougherty.
Edward O. Proctor, Sr., argued the cause for appellees. On the brief for appellee Boston & Maine Railroad was Edward B. Hanify. With Mr. Proctor on the brief for appellees McGinnis et al. were William T. Griffin, Lothrop Withington and John M. Reed. [380 U.S. 157, 158]
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. 3731, from the District Court's order dismissing Count I of an indictment (225 F. Supp. 577) for failure to state an offense under 10 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 734, 15 U.S.C. 20. That section provides in relevant part:
"No common carrier engaged in commerce shall have any dealings in securities, supplies, or other articles of commerce, or shall make or have any contracts for construction or maintenance of any kind, to the amount of more than $50,000, in the aggregate, in any one year, with another corporation, firm, partnership, or association when the said common carrier shall have upon its board of directors or as its president, manager, or as its purchasing or selling officer, or agent in the particular transaction, any person who is at the same time a director, manager, or purchasing or selling officer of, or who has any substantial interest in, such other corporation, firm, partnership, or association, unless and except such purchases shall be made from, or such dealings shall be with, the bidder whose bid is the most favorable to such common carrier, to be ascertained by competitive bidding under regulations to be prescribed by rule or otherwise by the Interstate Commerce Commission. . . ." (Italics added.)

"The substantial interest of defendants McGinnis and Glacy in defendant International consisted of an understanding, agreement, relationship, arrangement and concert of action among the said defendants McGinnis, Glacy, and International, and others, for, among other things, the purpose of producing profits for International from dealings by it in property acquired from the B&M through the intervention, direction or assistance of defendants McGinnis, Glacy, and Benson, and pursuant to which defendants McGinnis, Glacy, and Benson were to and did receive substantial monies."
"The statute is limited to one who has a then present legal interest in the buying corporation and does not include one whose only interest is in the outcome of what may have been an illegal and illicit plan to siphon off for his personal benefit property of the Boston and Maine Railroad through the medium of International." 225 F. Supp., at 578. [380 U.S. 157, 160]
"The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is, perhaps, not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department." Id., p. 95.
246 U.S. 533
What is the reach of 10? It is not strictly a conflict of interest statute such as we dealt with in United States v. Mississippi Valley Co., 364 U.S. 520 . In Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. United States, 361 U.S. 173, 190 , we described 10 as "an antitrust law."
Section 10, indeed, has its roots in President Wilson's message to Congress of January 20, 1914, on the subject of "trusts," in which he denounced the abuses of "interlockings of the personnel of the directorates of great corporations." 51 Cong. Rec. 1962-1964; H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 17-18. Section 10 started as part of 9 of the House bill and forbade certain types of interlocking office-holding. See S. Doc. No. 584, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10. The Senate made two main changes. First, it did not prohibit interlocking office-holding but seized rather on competitive bidding as the control. S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 47-48. Second, the Senate required competitive bidding not only when a director or other officer or agent of a common carrier was also a director or other officer of any firm with which the carrier had dealings to the amount of more than [380 U.S. 157, 161]   $50,000 in any one year, but also when the director or other officer of a common carrier had "any direct or indirect interest in" the other firm. S. Doc. No. 584, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 13. The Conference changed the phrase "any direct or indirect interest in" to the present wording "any substantial interest in." Id., pp. 13-14. As Senator Chilton, one of the Conferees, reported:
". . . It not only prevents corporations which are interlocked by officers and directors, but it says: `Or who has any substantial interest in such of them.'
"The Senator will recall all we had before us, the ease by which interlocking directorates could be gotten around; in other words, you could have your son, or your cousin, or your lawyer, or your agent upon the corporation and accomplish the same thing as if you were on the board yourself. . . .
. . . . .
". . . They can not dodge it by having a supply company, and even though they have discarded the form of interlocking directors, if there be the interest of the railroad or the common carrier in the supply company, as the Senator chooses to call it, then it is prohibited." 51 Cong. Rec. 15943.

Since the Government may choose to file, and the District Court may choose to allow, an amended bill of particulars, 3 we vacate and remand the case, leaving open all questions except our construction of the statute.
Vacated and remanded.

[ Footnote 2 ] The Commission reported: "Purchases of cars and coal are two large expenditures that railroads make. The New Haven purchased cars almost exclusively from James B. Brady without competition and to the extent of some $37,000,000. Mr. Brady, as a witness, made no secret of his generosity to the officials with whom he had business. His methods were justified by him on the ground that the officers of the New Haven were old friends." 31 I. C. C., at 61.
