As the [147 U.S. 374, 375]   facts of this case are substantially the same as the one just decided, (13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 348,) the decision must be the same.
The decree of the court below will therefore be reversed, and the case remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill.
Samuel Lord and Ira B. Jones, for appellants.
J. T. Barron and Henry A. M. Smith, for appellee.
Mr. Justice BROWN.
