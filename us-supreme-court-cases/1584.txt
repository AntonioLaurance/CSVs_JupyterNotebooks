(ORDER LIST: 580 U.S.)
MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2016 CERTIORARI -- SUMMARY DISPOSITIONS 15-1493 MANN, RUTHIE M. V. NORTH DAKOTA The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of North Dakota for further consideration in light of Birchfield v. North Dakota, 579 U. S. _____ (2016). 15-7813 LINDSEY, MICHAEL V. INDIANA The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals of Indiana, Fourth District for further consideration in light of the position asserted by Indiana in its brief for the respondent filed on May 23, 2016. The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito dissent for the reasons stated in Nunez v. United States, 554 U. S. 911, 912 (2008) (Scalia, J., dissenting). 15-7902 BROOKS, CARLTON V. LOUISIANA The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Second Circuit for further consideration in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ____ (2016). Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case: In granting this petition and now vacating and remanding the judgment below, the Court has not assessed whether petitioner's asserted entitlement to retroactive relief "is properly presented in the case." Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ___ (2016) (slip op., at 13). On remand, courts should understand that the Court's disposition of this petition does not reflect any view regarding petitioner's entitlement to relief. The Court's disposition does not, for example, address whether an adequate and independent state ground bars relief, whether petitioner forfeited or waived any entitlement to relief (by, for example, entering into a plea agreement waiving any entitlement to relief), or whether petitioner's sentence actually qualifies as a mandatory life without parole sentence. 15-9501 BOMAN, DONALD V.
