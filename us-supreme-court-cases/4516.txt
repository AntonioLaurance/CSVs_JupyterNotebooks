United States Supreme Court DEJOSEPH v. CONNECTICUT., (1966) No. 759 Argued:     Decided: June 16, 1966
Arbo was set free. The petitioner, convicted of the same offense in the same State, remains in jail. When the meaning of a fundamental constitutional right depends on which court in Connecticut a person turns to for redress, I believe it is time for this Court to intervene. I would grant certiorari and set this case for argument.
