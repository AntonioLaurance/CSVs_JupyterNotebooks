United States Supreme Court HARICH v. DUGGER, (1991) No. 90-7789 Argued:     Decided: April 23, 1991
Justice MARSHALL dissenting:
Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231 , 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant the application for stay of execution and the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.
