United States Supreme Court ORDER LIST 05/23/16, (2016) No. 052316zor Argued:     Decided: May 23, 2016
(ORDER LIST: 578 U.S.)
MONDAY, MAY 23, 2016 CERTIORARI -- SUMMARY DISPOSITIONS 15-1     JOHNSON, SHERMAINE A. V. MANIS, WARDEN The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ____ (2016). Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case: The Court has held the petition in this and many other cases pending the decision in Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ___ (2016). In holding this petition and now vacating and remanding the judgment below, the Court has not assessed whether petitioner's asserted entitlement to retroactive relief "is properly presented in the case." Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). On remand, courts should understand that the Court's disposition of this petition does not reflect any view regarding petitioner's entitlement to relief. The Court's disposition does not, for example, address whether an adequate and independent state ground bars relief, whether petitioner forfeited or waived any entitlement to relief (by, for example, entering into a plea agreement waiving any entitlement to relief), or whether petitioner's sentence actually qualifies as a mandatory life without parole sentence. Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand. I concur in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand. See Adams v. Alabama, 578 U. S. ____ (2016) (Alito, J., concurring). Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand. I concur in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand. See Adams v. Alabama, 578 U. S. ____ (2016) (Sotomayor, J., concurring). 15-620      JONES, ERIC A., ET AL. V. GILLIE, PAMELA, ET AL. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for further consideration in light of Sheriff v. Gillie, 578 U. S. ___ (2016). 15-785 PUNDT, EDWARD V. VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS, ET AL. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U. S. ___ (2016). 15-1100 CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ET AL. V. BURWELL, SEC. OF H&HS, ET AL. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in light of Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U. S. ___ (2016). Nothing in the Zubik opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by petitioners' health plans "obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives." Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1). Through this litigation, petitioners have made the Government aware of their view that they meet "the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds." Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). Nothing in the Zubik opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, "precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage" going forward. Ibid. Because the Government may rely on this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on petitioners for failure to provide the relevant notice. Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurs in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case for the reasons expressed in Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U. S. ___ (2016) (Sotomayor, J., concurring). 15-1131 MI CATHOLIC CONFERENCE, ET AL. V. BURWELL, SEC. OF H&HS, ET AL. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted.
