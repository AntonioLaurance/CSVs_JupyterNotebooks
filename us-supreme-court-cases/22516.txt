United States Supreme Court IN RE SCHNEIDER, (1893) Argued:     Decided: March 14, 1893
[148 U.S. 162, 166]
Mr. Chief Justice FULLER.
Leave to file petition for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari is denied. The ground of the application does not go to the jurisdiction or authority of the supreme court of the District, and mere error cannot be reviewed in this proceeding. Ex parte Parks, 93 U.S. 18 ; Ex parte Bigelow, 113 U.S. 328 , 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 542; Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417 , 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 935; Nielsen, Petitioner, 131 U.S. 176 , 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 672.
