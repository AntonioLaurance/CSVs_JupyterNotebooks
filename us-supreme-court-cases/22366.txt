United States Supreme Court IN RE MARIA LUISA COSTELL GAYDOS On Motion for Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis No. 96-5831., (1996) No. 96-5831 Argued:     Decided: December 23, 1996
We enter the order barring future in forma pauperis filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1 (1992). Because petitioner has limited her abuse of our processes to noncriminal cases, we limit our sanction accordingly.
It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 4 (1992), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
