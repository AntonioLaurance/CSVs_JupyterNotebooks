United States Supreme Court INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO. OF AMERICA v. COM. OF KENTUCKY, (1914) No. 298 Argued: April 24, 1914    Decided: June 8, 1914
We therefore reach the conclusion that the plaintiff in error was doing business in Kentucky and that the service was sufficient, but that the law under which the action was brought is unconstitutional, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed, and accordingly remand the case to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
