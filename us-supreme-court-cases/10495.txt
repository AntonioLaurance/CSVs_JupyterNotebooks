The District Court dismissed for lack of standing,
666 F. Supp. 2d 123, 127-131, and n. 10 (DC 2009), so it

in office of the Secretary of State under article I, section 6,
clause 2, of the Constitution." Joint Resolution on
Compensation and Other Emoluments Attached to the Office of
Secretary of State, §1(b)(3)(A), Pub. L. 110-455, 122 Stat.
5036, note following 5 U. S. C. §5312. The appeal is therefore
dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
