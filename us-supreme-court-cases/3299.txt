CERTIORARI -- SUMMARY DISPOSITIONS
09-1361 RENO, NV, ET AL. V. CONN, CHARLA, ET AL.
The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The
judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for further
consideration in light of Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. ____
(2011).
10-8943 JONES, DONALD G. V. SUPREME COURT OF U.S., ET AL.
Because the Court lacks a quorum, 28 U. S. C. §1, and the
qualified Justices are of the opinion that the case cannot be
heard and determined at the next Term of the Court, the judgment
is affirmed under 28 U. S. C. §2109, which provides that under
these circumstances "the court shall enter its order affirming
the judgment of the court from which the case was brought for
review with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally
divided court." The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, Justice
Kennedy, Justice Thomas, and Justice Breyer took no part in the
consideration or decision of this petition.
