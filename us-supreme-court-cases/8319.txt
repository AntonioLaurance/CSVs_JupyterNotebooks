United States Supreme Court MARIO CLAIBORNE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES, (2007) No. 06-5618 Argued:     Decided: June 4, 2007
Per Curiam.
The Court is advised that the petitioner died in St. Louis, Missouri, on May 30, 2007. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is therefore vacated as moot. See United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36 (1950).
It is so ordered.
